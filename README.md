# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Coursera-Repo
##Course Project
This repo contains the "run_analysis.R" script and a codebook containing the values.

The scripts takes for granted that the data have been unziped and it must be put in the initial folder with the unziped data.
The analysis from the script tidies the data as asked from the 5 steps and creates the "tidy_data.txt" file that is uploaded in the course project form.
